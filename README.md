# Computational_Algebra_LU_Transfer
the linear algebra LU transfer and higher iteration of matrix calculation.

## Linear algebra - Gaussian elimination and LU factorization
the random A matrix (size: n * n) which LU is guaranteed to work

### LU_direct : the linear and direct transfer by using LU method
### LT/UT_transfer : not a direct transfer method
